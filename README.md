## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Publisher) Reflections

#### Reflection Publisher-1

1. In the Observer pattern diagram explained by the Head First Design Pattern book, Subscriber is defined as an interface. Explain based on your understanding of Observer design patterns, do we still need an interface (or trait in Rust) in this BambangShop case, or a single Model struct is enough?

    In BambangShop case, assuming that there is only one type of Subscriber, a single Model struct is enough. However, if we refer to the Dependency Inversion Principle and Open-Closed Principle, it is actually better to make interface for Subscriber, because according to the DIP the code must depend on abstraction. Also, if there will be multiple type of Subscriber, abstraction (interface) is better to maintain according to the Open-Closed Principle.

2. id in Program and url in Subscriber is intended to be unique. Explain based on your understanding, is using Vec (list) sufficient or using DashMap (map/dictionary) like we currently use is necessary for this case?

    Based on my understanding, it is necessary to use DashMap because it will be easier to access the data using DashMap instead of using a Vec. Most of the operation using map/dictionary-like data structure is constant, so it will be better performance wise.

3. When programming using Rust, we are enforced by rigorous compiler constraints to make a thread-safe program. In the case of the List of Subscribers (SUBSCRIBERS) static variable, we used the DashMap external library for thread safe HashMap. Explain based on your understanding of design patterns, do we still need DashMap or we can implement Singleton pattern instead?

    In BambangShop case, both DashMap and Singleton Pattern is used. Singleton is used because we don't need multiple database/repository instance for the app. DashMap is used because it is a data structure that is thread safe and is suitable for multithreading.
